I once was a recruiter.

The best part: talk to interesting high impact people and how they work.

The bad part: entering all that data in a database somewhere. and inevitably having to manually keep track of it all making sure its right.

So I made this tool. its still a work in progress, but right now, it can:

- Feed in a text transcript file as input. think "recruiter: hows your day? candidate: good thanks"

- In return, the below will be completed.
  - add the candidate's personal info in a candidates table
  - add any work experience discussed into a work experience table
  - add the entire call as a note into a notes table
  - decide on next action based on context of call
  - vectorize the work experience table for very quick searches

and much more to come.
